## 2023.05 Update
1. Archive manager optimization
2. A series of catchain (basic consensus protocol) security improvements
3. Update for Fift libraries and FunC: better error-handling, fixes for `catch` stack recovery
4. A series of out message queue handling optimization (already deployed during emergency upgrades between releases)

Besides the work of the core team, this update is based on the efforts of @aleksej-paschenko (portability improvement), [Disintar team](https://github.com/disintar/) (archive manager optimization) and [sec3-service](https://github.com/sec3-service) security auditors (funC improvements).
